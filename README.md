A Java cross-platform GUI app for stripping pictures from meta-tags before publishing them on the internets.

You will be amazed on how many details users give every day to everybody by not stripping out the tags. Sometimes, they even give away the GPS location of their houses because GeoTagging on their smartphone is enabled.
